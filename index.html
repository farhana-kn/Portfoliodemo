                <p>
                    Mark Elliot Zuckerberg (/ˈzʌkərbɜːrɡ/; born May 14, 1984) is an American business magnate, computer
                    programmer, internet entrepreneur, and philanthropist. He co-founded the social media service
                    Facebook and its parent company Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook, Inc.), of which he is executive
                    chairman, chief executive officer and controlling shareholder.[1][2]

                    Zuckerberg attended Harvard University, where he launched Facebook in February 2004 with his
                    roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. Originally launched
                    in only select college campuses, the site expanded rapidly and eventually beyond colleges, reaching
                    one billion users in 2012. Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. In
                    2007, at age 23, he became the world's youngest self-made billionaire. He has since used his funds
                    to organize multiple philanthropic endeavors, including the establishment of the Chan Zuckerberg
                    Initiative.

                        expand on what Instagram does best but with text to create a positive space for people to
                        express their ideas.The app drew 10 million users just seven hours after launch. Zuckerberg said
                        he thinks it could be bigger than Twitter. There are currently around 23 million active users on
